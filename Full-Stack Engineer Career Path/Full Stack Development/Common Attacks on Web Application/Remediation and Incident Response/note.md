# Remediation and Incident Response
- In Cybersecurity, the term incident is when something bad happens, like a breach or policy violation, that harms or potentially harms the security of a system.

## Remediation
- “The act of mitigating a vulnerability or a threat”
- => “the process of fixing a security issue”
- It could be patching a vulnerability in a piece of software, removing malware from an infected computer, or kicking a malicious attacker out of a network.
- Remediation can happen before an incident takes place.

## Incident Response
- “The mitigation of violations of security policies and recommended practices.”
- => “everything that needs to happen to investigate and recover from an incident”

### The Incident Response Lifecycle
- Incident response begins before an incident even occurs, with preparations to ensure that an organization is able to respond quickly when an incident does occur.
- These preparations can include training, ensuring access to tools, and creating incident response plans that contain details about what to do when an incident happens.
- The security team’s primary concerns will usually be analysis, containment, and remediation.
- Other groups within an organization will have their own tasks, such as handling disclosure, communicating with law enforcement, etc.
- usually involving cyberattacks, remediation may be delayed to allow investigators to gather information without tipping the attackers off.
- After an incident, an organization will conduct reviews of what happened, and use that knowledge to improve security and procedures, to prevent similar incidents, and respond more effectively to incidents in the future.
-  Incident Response Playbook that contains procedures outlining what needs to happen to respond to an incident. These playbooks contain information on what constitutes an incident, what procedures should be enacted and by who, who needs to be contacted, etc…
