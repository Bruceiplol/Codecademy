# Normalization
- The process of restructuring a database in this way is called normalization
- the most common are first, second, and third normal form (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
- When columns of a database table do not depend on (i.e., describe) the primary key, the same data may be duplicated in multiple places.
- potential problem that can arise when all columns in a table do not depend on the primary key: new data cannot be inserted into the table until a primary key is known.
