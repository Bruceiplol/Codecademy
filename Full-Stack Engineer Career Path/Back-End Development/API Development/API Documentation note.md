# API Documentation
- API documentation is technical content containing instructions about how to effectively use and integrate with an API.
- It’s a concise reference manual containing all the information required to work with the API.
- includes tutorials with examples and details about the functions, classes, return types, arguments, and much more.
- Among all the phases in the API lifecycle, documentation is the area showing the most growth.

### Benefits of Well-Crafted API Documentation
- **Improved End-User Adoption**: having good API documentation is that it improves the experience for developers using the API, which directly correlates with API adoption. People adopt APIs they enjoy using, and if we get documentation right, more people will find value in the services easily, leading to better growth and adoption.
- **Improved Developer Experience (DX)**: The third-party developer, typically one of many end-users for an API, is busy solving complex programming challenges. These developers want to integrate as quickly as possible to move forward in their software development, meaning they should immediately understand the value and usage of the API. The aggregate experience of the developer when discovering, learning to use, and finally integrating with an API is termed as developer experience (DX) — and excellent API documentation is the key to a great DX.
- **Increased Awareness**: Satisfied end-users will be an APIs biggest advocates. As more end-users adopt an API and reach critical mass, there will be a probable increase in evangelism and word-of-mouth publicity by satisfied end-users.
- **Saves Support Time and Costs**: good documentation decreases the amount of time spent onboarding new end-users, be it internal developers or external partners. Poor or no documentation means more frustrated users rely on a team to understand how to work with the API. In contrast, individuals and teams save countless hours responding to support requests when end-users are given the ability to try out the API before implementing it and are armed with detailed documentation to get started.
- **Easier Maintenance**: It helps internal teams know the details of an API’s resources, methods, and their associated requests and responses, making maintenance and updates quicker.

### Who is the API documentation for?
- **Decision-makers**: Decision-makers are the people who evaluate an APIs services and decide if it makes sense for the development team to spend time exploring the service. Examples of decision-makers are CTOs or Product Managers.
- **Users**: Users are the people who will be directly working with an API. They need to learn the ins and outs of the API and how it applies to their use case. This could mean learning how to call and integrate with many, or all, of the resources the API exposes. Examples of API users are front-end and back-end developers.

## Best Practices
### Detailed Error Messages
Error messages are important because they tell end-users when they’re integrating with an API incorrectly. Explain error standards and provide solutions on how to overcome them when an end-user gets an error.
### A List of All Exposed Resources
Resources are the core components of an API that end-users will constantly be interacting with. 
### A Terms of Use Agreement
Terms of use is a legal agreement between the end-user and an organization, defining how the end-user should ideally use the API’s services. These terms should include API limits under best practices, with terms and conditions. Constraints also need to be clearly stated so that end-users understand what API usage and practices are permitted.
### A Changelog
A changelog is a document, usually published on an APIs website, that should detail updates and versions of an API and how it might affect API end-users. This will help end-users know the stability of the API and see if any changes need to be made to their integration with the API.
### Less Technical Jargon
Keep in mind that many end-users working with an API may not have intimate knowledge of the domain to understand technical jargon. Documentation should cater to the “very technical” developer audience and the less technical decision-makers.
### Examples of all Requests and Responses
An API call response is a guide for end-users, indicating whether they’re on the right track or are doing something wrong. An API end-user should know exactly what to expect from a successful API call. Ideally, an API provides examples for every single object it is supposed to return and examples of parameters that end-users can add for a successful call.<br>

It is also best to describe the entire sample response body in every supported format. Think of standard formats like XML or JSON, but also HTTP headers, error codes, and messages.
### An Authentication Guide
An API’s documentation should have a section dedicated to any authentication (if it exists) required to start consuming the API’s data. Make sure this section is adequately documented and hand-holds end-users to authenticate against the API successfully.
