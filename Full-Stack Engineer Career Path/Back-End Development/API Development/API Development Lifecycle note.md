# API development lifecycle
Creating an API encompasses a series of steps, each with its own complex processes. This collection of steps is known as the API development lifecycle.
<br><br>
Five chronological stages:
1. Planning and Designing the API
2. Developing the API
3. Testing the API
4. Deploying and Managing the API
5. Retiring the API

### Planning and Designing the API
- ideating and mapping out the various resources and operations and their associated use cases before the API is fully implemented in code.
- business team members (or sometimes even engineers) will begin by mapping out the capabilities of the API and the data it should expose. This process usually captures the API audience’s needs and the requirements from various stakeholders.
- engineering teams can then begin laying out the architecture of the API. Naming conventions, protocols, technology, and much more are debated and finalized.

### Developing the API
- This stage focuses on implementing the API based on the plan and design and is when engineering teams will do the necessary work to bring the API to life.
- this is also where the API is documented.

### Testing the API
-  This phase typically catches any issues so that engineering teams can refine the API before it is released to the end-users

### Deploying and Managing the API
- APIs are ready for release and are deployed to a secure environment to facilitate easy discovery and consumption.
- APIs are released into beta where end-users (sometimes only a small percentage) can test and experiment with the API and give feedback and report bugs.
- The beta helps finalize any outstanding issues as well as gain valuable feedback before a full API release.
- where APIs are managed for the rest of their lifetime to deliver guaranteed and high-quality API performance.

### Retiring the API
- where support for an API’s version, or in many cases, an entire API itself, is discontinued.
- creating a detailed plan on migrating users away from the API and releasing the APIs resources.
